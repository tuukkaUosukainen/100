# A Simple Todo App
Practice project from: https://www.webtips.dev/100-javascript-project-ideas. Instead of React Native using browser. In this project I tried TDD for unit tests. It's fun but, I need to practice my discipline and do one thing at a time. If the test are naive, forgive me :0

## It should:
* Be able to add new elements to a list
* Be able to remove existing elements from a list
* ~~Be able to rename existing elements in a list~~ - decided not to implement this :)
* Be able to see the number of complete and incomplete elements

## The UI Should
* Show current date
* Show a list of incomplete todos
* Show a list of completed todos
* ~~Show a checkbox for each todo to toggle complete~~ - decided to use button
* Show a form for adding new todos

## To run the program
* Clone the project
* npm install
* npm start

## To run unit tests
* npm run test

## To run E2E tests
* npm run cypress
