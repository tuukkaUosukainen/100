# A Simple Todo App
Practice project from: https://www.webtips.dev/100-javascript-project-ideas. Instead of React Native using browser. In this project I tried TDD for unit tests. It's fun but, I need to practice my discipline and do one thing at a time. If the tests are naive, forgive me :0

## Conclusion
It was a long time since doing DOM manipulation by hand. It's quite cumbersome after doing stuff with React. It really made me appreciate the frontend frameworks much more. I think that code is quite messy but I decided that it's time to move on to the next project. All-in-all it was a fun project and good change to try TDD with unit tests.  

## It should:
* Be able to add new elements to a list: DONE
* Be able to remove existing elements from a list: DONE
* ~~Be able to rename existing elements in a list~~ - decided not to implement this :)
* Be able to see the number of complete and incomplete elements: Done

## The UI Should
* Show current date: Done
* Show a list of incomplete todos: Done, but in same listing
* Show a list of completed todos: Done, but in same listing
* ~~Show a checkbox for each todo to toggle complete~~ - decided to use button
* Show a form for adding new todos: Done
