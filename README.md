# 100
This repo is for exercise projects. I'm reading a book with the one and only Ferrix Hovi about habits. Inspired by the book I decided to build a habit on writing code exercises. Google gave me this: https://www.webtips.dev/100-javascript-project-ideas and that is what I chose.

This is the book, BTW: https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits.
